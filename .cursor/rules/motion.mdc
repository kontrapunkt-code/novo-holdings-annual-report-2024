# Motion

- Use motion.dev's `animate()` function for animation.
- Follow the docs of motion from motion.dev.
- Use spring easings whereever possible.
- Always use the latest version.
- There is NO key called `easing` it is correctly called `ease`.
- Always use duration in seconds with using the `animate()` method.
