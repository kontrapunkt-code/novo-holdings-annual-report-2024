# Tailwind CSS

- Always use Tailwind version 4.0
- Use CSS configuration with version 4.0 in [global.css](mdc:apps/web/src/styles/global.css)
- Keep classes as short and tidy as possible.
- Use mobile first design.
- Only use the "md:" media query to differentiate between mobile and desktop.
- If many components share the same classes, consider making a global class in [global.css](mdc:apps/web/src/styles/global.css)
